# Emotion controlled arduino mobile robot using IBM Watson Tone Analyzer

ABSTRACT : 
	In this project, we are particularly interested in controlling the movement of arduino robot. We, by using Google Speech Recognizer(which is integrated inside the client side of user browser), convert the audio to the text and detect the emotions using IBM Watson Tone Analyzer.

• LIMITATIONS :-
	o Google Speech Recognizer for JavaScript works only on Google Chrome browser.
	o Wave Features of voice are not used. Thus actual emotion might not be found.
• FUTURE SCOPE :-
	o The project can be linked to a operation by spies.
	o We can control a robot without any coded language.
	o We can analyze the wave features of voice for a more accurate answer.

CONCLUSIONS :
	IBM Watson Tone analyzer API is descent text analysis tool for emotion detection. We can analyze the audio wave features for a more accurate emotion detection from voice. End result of our project can be used for various applications like remotely controlling a robot, guiding someone in a confidential area or can be used in secret missions.
